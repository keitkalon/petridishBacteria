# petridishBacteria
C# CLI  representation of bacteria ecosystem evolving on a Petri Dish

We have 3 LifeForm:

Coccus,
Spirillum and
Bacillus

All 3 Life forms interact if they are in proximity one with another: <br>
they can eat each other<br>
or<br>
can thrive if they are in proximity,
It all depends on the Species type.

On each press of a button we can see how somehow randomly and<br> 
somehow after following precise laws their life change on each unit of click
